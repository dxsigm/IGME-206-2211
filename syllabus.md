# IGME-206, Game Development for Programmers, Fall 2021: Syllabus

## Course Catalog Description

*An intensive review of the core features for problem solving within the domain of game design and development for students with a prior software development background. Topics include using existing frameworks, game software architecture, data structures, algorithms, threads, object-oriented design, and data-oriented development appropriate for games, simulations, or entertainment applications.  Programming assignments are a required part of this course.*

## Course Goals and Objectives
At the end of this course, a student should be able to implement moderately large programming projects either individually and/or in a team. Specifically, a student should:
- Create game and entertainment software using standard game software development techniques
- Use threading for file I/O in loading a game level
- Perform unit testing as well as use version control for their projects.
- Describe algorithmic complexity differences between standard algorithms for searching and sorting
- Develop and use appropriate data structures for game and entertainment software

We will assess all of this work with in-class exercises, homework, projects, and exams, as discussed below.

## Course Structure
- Unit 1 (weeks 1-3): C# Syntax and Procedural Programming (textbook chapters 1-6)
- In-class Project Presentations End of Week 4
- Unit 2 (weeks 4-6): Object Oriented Programming (textbook chapters 8-11, pdf and ppt documents, schUML documentation)
- Unit 3 (weeks 7-12): Data Structures (pdf and ppt documents)
- Unit 4 (weeks 13-15): Data Oriented Programming (pdf and ppt documents)
- In-class Final Project Presentations Last Lecture in Week 15

## Course Materials and Communication
_Beginning C#_ by Karli Watson, et al.

Most course materials and example code will be distributed via GitHub and myCourses, and you will also be learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage your own project files.

myCourses will be used for announcements, links to course content, quizzes and exams, assignment submissions, and grading.

A Slack workspace (https://rit-igme-206-01-2211.slack.com) has been created to provide an avenue of communication between professors, teaching assistants, and students. You should use Slack as your primary way for getting in touch with your professor (unless instructed otherwise) and use email only for ‘official business’ where a more formal record is required.  The Slack server will be either deleted or wiped clean at the end of the semester, so be sure to ‘save’ any great piece of information you see on it elsewhere.  Please request membership in our Slack workspace within the first day of classes.

## Attendance
Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and will be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early unless specifically dismissed).  Due to the impact of COVID-19, I understand that your ability to attend every lecture may be affected.  Therefore your attendance is based on your overall engagement in the course and not just being present for the on-line lectures.

## Grading
Final course grades are determined using the following scale:

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 65+%	| D |
| <65%	| F |

### Project (25%)
-	A Unity-based game to be demonstrated during the final class on Nov X, 2021.  Final submission due the last day of finals.

### Exams (40%)
These take-home exams, for which you will have at least 9 days to complete, consist of all manner of question styles (multiple choice, true/false, matching, etc) as well as "write some code" questions. There will be no make-ups or re-takes allowed without prior permission.
-	Unit Test 1 (10%): due week 5
-   Unit Test 2 (10%): due week 9
-   Unit Test 3 (10%): due week 14
-	Final Exam  (10%): due last day of finals

### Homework & other assignments (30%)
Homeworks, in-class exercises, checkpoints, and other assignments are essential to learning the course material. You can expect an average of one Practice Exercise per class meeting. Keep an eye on the myCourses Assignments section for the due dates.

Assignments never submitted on myCourses, or submitted LATE without a valid excuse will receive a score of ZERO for that assignment. (Procrastination is not a valid excuse). If you feel you have legitimate excuse, please contact the professor in **advance** of the due date either by email or during office hours.

As far as I am able, I will review and provide feedback on assignments submitted more than 24 hours early, and you may resubmit the assignment up until the deadline.  An iterative feedback process can be a powerful learning experience, and my goal is for you to learn the material.

### Attendance, Participation and Engagement (5%)
Your engagement in the class will be graded based on attendance, early homework submissions, office hour communication, and Slack and Help Dropbox activity.

### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, solely for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed at the end of week 11, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty.

### Academic Dishonesty
The course policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an "F" as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.) Please review RIT's policy on academic dishonesty: http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html

## Important RIT Deadlines
-	Last day of add/drop is Wednesday, August X, 2021.
-	Last day to withdraw with a grade of "W" is Tuesday, November X, 2021.
-	You have one semester after the class has ended to challenge your grade.

## Notices of Accommodation
If you have a "Notice of Accommodation", your professor should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class, via Slack, or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met.

## Discrimination and Harassment
