video covers
- instatiation of food
	-probably also going to go with pizza becouse pizza
	-recomended scale up
	-no grav drop
	-move forward at 40f
	-rotates right at delta * 500
	-destroy at far end
	-only one can exist at a time
	-max limit of 10
-instatiation of animals
	-doe fox moose used, can be anything, colorfull giant chickens might be funny, attack of the chocobo
	-probably going to use diferent tags of slow med and fast instead of searching name
	-speed is 40
	-not sure if there is a performance diference between empty navmesh and just flying through space, minimal if their is
	-target pos is 5 behind the player
	-destroy at close end
-spawner
	-use a standard spawner for animals
	-invoke repeating wait 2s repeat 1.5s
-score keeper
	-just stores variabls at this point
	-food count
	-fast = 1, faster = 2, fastest = 3
	-level will be scaler for rate of spawn
-collisions
	-destroy food
	-set animal collider to false
	-animal run random away
-plyer explosion
	--controled by bool called gameover


Note: probably gong to use on collision enter then check tag instead of trigger
      -personal pref to AI navMesh
      -ground is now static
      -animals need a rigidbody and navMesh agent added
      -added most score keeper functionality to player class
      -abandoned invoke repeating since i cant stop the spawning after i die
      -I have already implemented the death smoke and animation

bug: cant stop animals from spawning after death
fix: once invoked you cant uninvoke, using my own timer i have more control

bug: dirt still flys after death if moving when die
fix: logic error, since dirt loops i still need to check if its playing when i die and then turn it bcak off
