Note: 	Space is bound to fire 1 as of v2
		-check comment on jump to make sure I removed space from the jump options
	-animals are the only ones that collision detect. player and food dont collide with anything else
	-im starting to have too many different local things called player, its time to clean up some of the scripts
	-for dont destroy on load i dont have a score object, i can add player controler to dont destroy on load 
		-or just make player in player controler static for same result
		-decided to just make a single static player object in a new class M_Player

bug: can still throw pizza when in the air
fix: added a grounded check to throw
