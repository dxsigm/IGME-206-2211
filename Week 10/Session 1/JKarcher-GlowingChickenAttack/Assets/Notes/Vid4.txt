Notes:  -TMPro for ever
	-Ill use a ui panel for the backdrop
	-I plan to use the gui on-click listener
	-I dont like the screen snap to defult or how long the smoke seems to have stoped before it is officially done
		-ill leave it for now since last assignment is to change the start levelup and game over anyway

bug: scene is reloaded, no errors, no movement, no spawning
fix: i forgot to set the game over trigger back to false when the game can continue

bug: player controler, to stop the player from reorienting themselves in the air i stoped checking for a new position for target
		-results in player jumping to target but never past
fix: when in the air i reset the target to infinity and (-)infinity depending on the orientation at the time of jump so the player can never reach target
